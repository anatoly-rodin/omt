The ultimate goal of OMT is to overhaul online brokerage industry by merging the ingenuity of the crypto landscape with the international financial ecosystem and implementing blockchain protocols in the trading of physical financial assets. OMT tokenization framework allows investments to be more liquid and divisible among a greater number of people — an attribute that greatly reduces transaction costs and increases economies of scale. As a result, investors are exposed to more flexible and sophisticated investment instruments which can be tailored to meet the needs of investors allowing for increased accessibility to diversity, risk, return, and market exposure profiles.</p>

                                    An investor will use OMToken in his wallet to purchase shares and other security instruments structured as cryptocurrency creating a permanent record of a digital transaction immutable, secure and fast.

                            <p class="text">OMT is the world’s first fee-less decentralized stock trading platform built 100% on blockchain. Our built-in wallet fetches stock quotes from major stock exchanges and passes them to smart contract comparing the start price, end price, expiry price and reward winning traders immediately through smart contract. Additional database and server-side are required to process the trade data through clearing companies, centralized record holders and settling banks – per SEC regulations.</p>
                            <p class="text">OMT trade clearance is to be set to rout all our retail flow to securities clearing brokers, by directing such orders to market making companies. A market maker makes a profit for itself and OMT by selling high and buying low. Market makers establish quotes whereby the bid price is set slightly lower than listed prices and the ask price is set slightly higher in order to earn a small margin. OMT is taking this one step further by offering users the opportunity to execute trades in our own Etherium blockchain fork, which increases security, execution speed and liquidity eventualy. The OMT trading application, is being developed for devices using iOS, Android or Windows Mobile operation systems is set to interact seamlessly with the Etherium blockchain ?fork?.</p>
