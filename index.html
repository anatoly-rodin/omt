                                                <span>OMToken is replacing traditional privately held securities with tokenized contracts, representing “Profit Right”, which gives an investor the right to receive a percentage of future profits, but not money that is used for day-to-day operations. Profit Right is similar to a stock option, because they both represent a share in the future company value. This tokenization model is creating an alternative avenue through the combination of digital token schemes, with zero-to-minimum involvement of contracts, insurance, auditing and third-party guarantees so that parties can transact in an ecosystem where trust, time, and capital are much less of an issue.</span>

Omtoken is set to replace private security holdings into tokenized “Profit Right” contracts giving the investor the right of a set percentage of future profits. This process is similar to a stock option in that it represents a share in future company value. This model relies on a combination of tokenization and due diligence procedures consisting of contracts, insurance, audits, and third party guarantee to create an ecosystem of trust, timeliness, and value.</span>

Our built-in wallet fetches stock quotes from major stock exchanges and passes them to smart contract comparing the start price, end price, expiry price and reward winning traders immediately through smart contract. Additional database and server-side are required to process the trade data through clearing companies, centralized record holders and settling banks – per SEC regulations.</p>
                            <p class="text">OMT trade clearance is to be set to rout all our retail flow to securities clearing brokers, by directing such orders to market making companies. A market maker makes a profit for itself and OMT by selling high and buying low. Market makers establish quotes whereby the bid price is set slightly lower than listed prices and the ask price is set slightly higher in order to earn a small margin. OMT is taking this one step further by offering users the opportunity to execute trades in our own Etherium blockchain fork, which increases security, execution speed and liquidity eventualy. The OMT trading application, is being developed for devices using iOS, Android or Windows Mobile operation systems is set to interact seamlessly with the Etherium blockchain fork.</p>
